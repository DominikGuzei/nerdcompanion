			<p>This guide focuses on the interaction between Controller and View in the Model-View-Controller triangle. As you know, the Controller is responsible for orchestrating the whole process of handling a request in Rails, though it normally hands off any heavy code to the Model. But then, when it&#8217;s time to send a response back to the user, the Controller hands things off to the View. It&#8217;s that handoff that is the subject of this guide.</p>
			<p>In broad strokes, this involves deciding what should be sent as the response and calling an appropriate method to create that response. If the response is a full-blown view, Rails also does some extra work to wrap the view in a layout and possibly to pull in partial views. You&#8217;ll see all of those paths later in this guide.</p>
